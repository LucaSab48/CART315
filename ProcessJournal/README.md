## Make a Thing |01.23.25
For this Make a Thing project, I decided to visualize a short story. I initially wanted to pick a short story from Junji-Ito, however I soon realized how difficult it would be to create it with the tools given. I really wanted to make a platformer game using GB studios, yet my computers anti-virus software would not allow me to open GB studios. So I settled on Bitsy as my choice of creation tools. I then decided to adapt one of my favorite HP Lovecraft stories, “The Outsider”. 
This is because of its platformer-esque nature and the fact that there is only one character in the whole story. The story is mainly about a man stuck in a large castle, wrestling with his own identity and existence. Once he finally escapes to the real world, he is faced with the fact that he is a monster and shunned by society.
I was only able to adapt the first half of the story unfortunately, due to time limit constraints. I decided to make a puzzle lock-and-key game where the user must find his way out of the castle to discover who they truly are. I tried making different objects from the story to convey the narrative, however the sprite editor tool in bitsy is very limited. So I adjusted it to be only a couple objects and a bunch of notes scattered across the map. 
I made the ending kind of hidden to extend the game time and play into the narrative of the creature (the player) hiding the exit to avoid his reality. The themes I explore are identity, isolation, and existentialism.

Playtest thoughts:
-	I made the game too annoying
-	I wish I spent more time making better looking sprites and more interesting backgrounds
-	People tend to skip the dialogue
-	Puzzle games are probably not the best games for a small demonstration
-	I think I made the game too long without having a strong enough narrative
-	People did not look for hidden walls without me indicating it to them
